test('AI: Should load homepage successfully', async () => {
  // AI detected critical performance requirement
  const startTime = Date.now();
  await navigateToPage(page, BASE_URL);
  const loadTime = Date.now() - startTime;
  
  // AI analysis: Performance should be under 3 seconds
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(3000);
  
  // AI detected these critical elements from screenshot:
  const hasMainHeading = await findElementByText(page, 'Welcome', 'h1');
  expect(hasMainHeading).toBe(true);
  
  // AI-generated accessibility check
  const accessibility = await analyzeAccessibility();
  expect(accessibility.hasTitle).toBe(true);
  
  // AI captures evidence
  await takeScreenshot(page, 'ai-homepage-verification');
});
```
